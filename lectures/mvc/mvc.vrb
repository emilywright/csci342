\frametitle{Virtues of Separating MVC} 
The other problem is there is no way to do multiple site skins
properly if you don't have proper separation of concerns. If you are
doing code generation or sites with different skins on them, there is
no way to properly make a new skin by simply copying and pasting the
old skin and changing it. If you have the view and the logic together,
when you make a copy of the view you copy the logic as well. That
breaks one of our primary rules as developers: have only one place to
change anything.
