  \item[CSCI 342, Fall 2016, Homework \# 1]
  \item[Due date:] Friday, Sept. 30, midnight.  Submit on canvas.
    \item[Instructions:]
I have provided a simple html file in the file {\tt hw01.html},
along with a couple of images.  You are to create a {\tt hw01.css}
file so that the resulting page looks as close as you can make it
to this:

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{screenshot.png}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
Do not make any changes in the {\tt hw01.html} file!
\item
There are several lists in my html file.  Make sure that the web page
handles increasing or decreasing the number of items in the lists
gracefully.
\item
  Snarky remarks about my style choices will result in lost points.
\end{itemize}
